This repo contains 4 files and those are explained as below:
- A PDF file named "Repeated Matching - Assignment" that describes a structural econometrics estimation problem I was asked to solve while studying for a doctoral degree in Quantitative Economics and Econometrics at Rice University. While it is in the context of repeated matching, its core includes a discrete time dynamic programming equation.
- A PDF File named "Repeated Matching - Solution" that contains my solutions to the problems by going through the following Julia scripts:
  - "Base-HK.jl" that stores the Chebyshev polinomial nodes used in the main file.
  - "Master-HK.jl" that includes the algorithm I developd to solve the problems laid out in the "Repeated Matching - Assignment" file.
